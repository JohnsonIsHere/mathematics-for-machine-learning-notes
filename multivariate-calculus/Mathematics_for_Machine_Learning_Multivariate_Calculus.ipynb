    "*  What are functions? \n",
    "   *  A function is a mathematical relationship between inputs and an output. It can be thought of as a machine that takes in one or more variables and produces a single, corresponding result. For example, a function for the temperature of a room might take in the coordinates ($x$,$y$,$z$) and time ($t$) as inputs and return the temperature at that specific point and time.\n",
    "   *  The notation $f(x)$ represents \"f as a function of x\", not \"f multiplied by x.\" This can be a point of confusion due to its seemingly arbitrary nature, but it's a standard convention in mathematical language.\n",
    "* The creative essence of science\n",
    "  * Selecting a function to model real-world data is a core, creative step in science and machine learning. This process involves formulating a **hypothesis**â€”a candidate function that could represent the relationship you're observing. Without this initial creative step, there would be nothing to test or investigate.\n",
    "* Introduction to Calculus\n",
    "  * **Calculus** is the study of how functions change with respect to their input variables. It provides a set of tools to investigate and manipulate these functions. By understanding calculus, you can analyze the behavior of functions and use them to model complex phenomena in the real world.\n",
    "* Gradients and Derivatives\n",
    "  * A great way to visualize this concept is with a **speed-time graph**.\n",
    "  * ![Speed time graph](images/speed_time_graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The **gradient** (or slope) of the graph at any point represents the **rate of change** of speed with respect to time, which is the **acceleration**.\n",
    "    * A positive gradient indicates acceleration, a negative gradient indicates deceleration, and a zero gradient (a flat horizontal line) means constant speed with zero acceleration.\n",
    "    * The gradient at a single point is called the **local gradient** and can be visualized as the slope of a tangent line that touches the curve at that point.\n",
    "  * By finding the local gradient at every point on a continuous function, we can create an entirely new function called its **derivative**. The derivative describes the original function's slope at every point.\n",
    "* Higher-Order Derivatives and Anti-Derivatives\n",
    "  * This process can be repeated. The derivative of the acceleration function is called the **jerk**, which represents the rate of change of acceleration. This concept is useful for describing the \"jerky\" motion of a car as it starts and stops. The jerk is the second derivative of the speed-time function.\n",
    "  * The inverse procedure, finding a function for which our original function is the derivative, is called the **anti-derivative**. For our speed-time example, the anti-derivative would be the **distance-time functio**n, as the rate of change of distance is speed. The anti-derivative is closely related to an integral."
