    "*  What are functions? \n",
    "   *  A function is a mathematical relationship between inputs and an output. It can be thought of as a machine that takes in one or more variables and produces a single, corresponding result. For example, a function for the temperature of a room might take in the coordinates ($x$,$y$,$z$) and time ($t$) as inputs and return the temperature at that specific point and time.\n",
    "   *  The notation $f(x)$ represents \"f as a function of x\", not \"f multiplied by x.\" This can be a point of confusion due to its seemingly arbitrary nature, but it's a standard convention in mathematical language.\n",
    "* The creative essence of science\n",
    "  * Selecting a function to model real-world data is a core, creative step in science and machine learning. This process involves formulating a **hypothesis**—a candidate function that could represent the relationship you're observing. Without this initial creative step, there would be nothing to test or investigate.\n",
    "* Introduction to Calculus\n",
    "  * **Calculus** is the study of how functions change with respect to their input variables. It provides a set of tools to investigate and manipulate these functions. By understanding calculus, you can analyze the behavior of functions and use them to model complex phenomena in the real world.\n",
    "* Gradients and Derivatives\n",
    "  * A great way to visualize this concept is with a **speed-time graph**.\n",
    "  * ![Speed time graph](images/speed_time_graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The **gradient** (or slope) of the graph at any point represents the **rate of change** of speed with respect to time, which is the **acceleration**.\n",
    "    * A positive gradient indicates acceleration, a negative gradient indicates deceleration, and a zero gradient (a flat horizontal line) means constant speed with zero acceleration.\n",
    "    * The gradient at a single point is called the **local gradient** and can be visualized as the slope of a tangent line that touches the curve at that point.\n",
    "  * By finding the local gradient at every point on a continuous function, we can create an entirely new function called its **derivative**. The derivative describes the original function's slope at every point.\n",
    "* Higher-Order Derivatives and Anti-Derivatives\n",
    "  * This process can be repeated. The derivative of the acceleration function is called the **jerk**, which represents the rate of change of acceleration. This concept is useful for describing the \"jerky\" motion of a car as it starts and stops. The jerk is the second derivative of the speed-time function.\n",
    "  * The inverse procedure, finding a function for which our original function is the derivative, is called the **anti-derivative**. For our speed-time example, the anti-derivative would be the **distance-time functio**n, as the rate of change of distance is speed. The anti-derivative is closely related to an integral."

    "* Defining the Derivative\n",
    "  * The derivative is the formal mathematical notation for the gradient of a function. For a linear function with a constant gradient, the slope is defined as \"**rise over run**.\"\n",
    "  * For a non-linear function where the gradient changes at every point, we define the derivative at a specific point $x$ by taking the limit of the \"rise over run\" formula. We consider a second point that is an infinitesimally small distance $Δx$ away from the first point. As this distance approaches zero, the line connecting the two points becomes a perfect approximation of the tangent line at point $x$. $$ \\frac{df}{dx} = f'(x) = \\lim_{Δx\\to0} (\\frac{f(x+Δx)-f(x)}{Δx}) $$\n",
    "    * The notation for the derivative can be either $f'(x)$ (read as \"f prime of x\")\n",
    "    * or $\\frac{df}{dx}$ (read as \"df by dx\"). \n",
    "    * The key idea is that we are not dividing by zero, but rather observing the behavior of the expression as $Δx$ gets extremely close to zero.\n",
    "* Fundamental Rules of Differentiation\n",
    "  * This definition, while powerful, can be tedious to apply directly to every function. Fortunately, we can derive and use general rules to simplify the process.\n",
    "  * **The Sum Rule**\n",
    "    * The derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of their individual derivatives. This means you can differentiate each term in a function separately and then add the results together.\n",
    "    * Example: The derivative of $f(x)=3x+2$ is the derivative of $3x$ plus the derivative of $2$.\n",
    "  * **The Power Rule**\n",
    "    * For a function in the form of $f(x) = ax^b$, its derivative is:\n",
    "    $$ f(x) = ax^b $$\n",
    "    $$ f'(x) = abx^{(b-1)} $$\n",
    "    * The rule is: multiply the coefficient by the original power, and then subtract 1 from the power.\n",

    "    * This derivative function is always negative, matching our visual observation that the original function's slope is always decreasing. Like the original function, the derivative is also undefined at $x = 0$.\n",
    "  * The Exponential Function ($e^x$)\n",
    "    * ![Derivative - Euler's Nimber ](images/derivative_eulers_number.png)\n",
    "    * The exponential function, $f(x) = e^x$, has  a unique and powerful property: **its derivative is itself**. $$ \\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x$$ \n",
    "    * This means the value of the function at any point is equal to its slope at that same point. This self-similarity is incredibly useful in calculus and other areas of mathematics. The constant $e$ (Euler's number), approximately 2.718, is fundamental to this function.\n",
    "      * The \"Designed\" Nature of the Exponential Function $e^x$\n",
    "        * The constant $e$ (Euler's number) is not a random value; it's specifically defined to satisfy a unique and powerful property in calculus. Its entire purpose is to make the derivative of the exponential function $f(x)=e^x$ equal to itself.\n",
    "      * Derivation of the Derivative\n",
    "        * We can see this by using the formal limit definition of the derivative for a general exponential function $f(x)=a^x$.$$ f'(x)=\\lim_{Δx\\to0} \\frac{f(x+Δx)-f(x)}{Δx} = \\lim_{Δx\\to0} \\frac{a^{x+Δx}-a^x}{Δx}$$\n",
    "        * Using the rule of exponents ($a^{x+y} =a^xa^y$), we can factor out $a^x$: $$ f'(x)=\\lim_{Δx\\to0} \\frac{a^x \\cdot a^{Δx}-a^x}{Δx} = a^x \\lim_{Δx\\to0} \\frac{a^{Δx}-1}{Δx} $$.\n",
    "        * For most values of the base $a$, the limit part of this expression will evaluate to some constant value other than 1.\n",
    "        * The number $e$ is precisely the value for the base a that makes this limit exactly 1: $$ \\lim_{Δx\\to0} \\frac{e^{Δx}-1}{Δx} $$\n",
    "        * Therefore, when we substitute $a=e$ back into our derivative expression, we get: $$ f'(x) = e^x \\cdot 1 = e^x $$\n",
    "      * This result shows that the rate of change of the function $e^x$ at any point is simply the value of the function itself at that point. This isn't a coincidence; it's the very reason why $e$ is so fundamental to calculus and the modeling of natural growth and decay processes.\n",
    "  * Trigonometric Functions (Sine and Cosine)\n",
    "    * ![Derivative - Sin and Cos ](images/derivative_sin_cos.png)\n",
    "    * The trigonometric functions sine and cosine have an interesting relationship when differentiated. They follow a cyclical pattern:\n",
    "      * The derivative of $\\sin(x)$ is $\\cos(x)$.\n",
    "      * The derivative of $\\cos(x)$ is $-\\sin(x)$.\n",
    "      * The derivative of $-\\sin(x)$ is $-\\cos(x)$.\n",
    "      * The derivative of $-\\cos(x)$ is $\\sin(x)$.\n",
    "    * After four differentiations, the function returns to its original form. This self-similarity is a hint that these functions are deeply related to the exponential function, although the connection is not immediately obvious.\n",
    "  * Ultimately, these examples demonstrate that even with complex functions, the core concept of differentiation remains the same: finding the \"rise over run\" at every point on the curve.\n",
