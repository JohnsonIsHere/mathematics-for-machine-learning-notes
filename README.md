# Mathematics for Machine Learning – Notes & Python Visualizations 📐

This repository contains my personal learning notes, Python implementations, and visual explanations based on the **Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization** by Imperial College London.

> The goal of this project is to build strong mathematical intuition for machine learning, reinforced through code and visual storytelling.

## 🔍 Specialization Overview

This 3-course series bridges the gap between academic math and its applications in Data Science & Machine Learning. Each course combines theory with hands-on Jupyter notebooks and interactive visualizations.
