## 🔍 Goals

- Build an intuitive and visual understanding of linear algebra for machine learning
- Connect theory with practical Python examples (NumPy/Matplotlib)
- Prepare for deeper study in model optimization, vector spaces, and transformations
- Serve as a reference for future data science and AI engineering work

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## 💡 Tips

If you're learning this for ML:
- Visualize every transformation — it helps deeply understand what's going on.
- Connect matrices to real-world transformations (rotations, reflections, projections).
- Don't just memorize formulas. Think geometrically.
